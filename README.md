The following challenge was completed in an effort to meet the following criteria:

GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state
WHEN I review the app’s store
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API
WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider
WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state
THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API
WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API

** Description **

Global State was removed and changed with redux, most of the components required updating and refactoring to accomadate for the changes made. All in all however, redux seems to be a much more condensed way of providing a global store capable of storing the neccessary information.
